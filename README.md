# Mint
Mint is a Discord bot made out of pure curiosity about programming around 2-3 years ago. As a revived project, Mint is now ready to serve in providing moderation, fun and social features!

## Features:
* Moderation commands to keep your server nice and tidy
* Social (Leveling, Currency)
* Anime pictures and gifs (seriosly, try `neko` it's posts very cute nekos)
* Gelbooru
* Commands to spice up the server with memes
* And other stuff I'm lazy to list myself, so you better to [invite the bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=424862035063603202&scope=bot&permissions=2146958839) and see it for yourself yourself!

## Todo List for now:

- [x] Rewrite database.py and modules that use it (Moved to MongoDB)
- [ ] Get a better hosting (Heroku sucks tbh)
- [x] Add more features to social.py
- [x] Make event handling process better
- [ ] Make leveling related graphics(?)
- [ ] Refactor the code (ugh)
