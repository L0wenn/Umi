# Mint
Mint is a Discord bot made out of pure curiosity about programming back 2-3 years ago. Now, as a revived project, Mint is ready to serve your server in a way of providing moderation, fun and social features!

## Features:
* Moderation commands to keep your server nice and tidy
* Social (Leveling, Currency)
* Anime pictures and gifs (seriosly, try `neko` it's posting very nice nekos)
* Gelbooru
* Commands to spice up the server with memes
* And other stuff I'm lazy to list myself, so you better to invite the bot and see it yourself!

[Invite the bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=424862035063603202&scope=bot&permissions=2146958839)


## Todo List for now:

- [ ] Rewrite database.py and modules that use it
- [ ] Get a better hosting (Heroku sucks tbh)
- [ ] Add more features to social.py
- [ ] Make event handling process better
- [ ] Make leveling related stuff look better (profiles, lvlups and etc as pics maybe?)
- [ ] Make settings module
- [ ] Refactor the code (ugh)
